To Do List for KODS
===================

- command completion still buggy when pressing <tab> more than once

- correctly implement batch mode with input file specified on
  command line

- convert all include files with common data to modules

- need CDGM glass catalog
- read .agf glass data files directly
- update all glass catalogs

- replace any hardcoded system commands

- 'make' does not work well with Fortran 90 modules. Need better
  build system (?)
  
- need icons for app and GUI

- eliminate compiler warnings

- separate user writable directories from library directories

- implement Qcon and Qbfs polynomials for aspheric surfaces

- ISO 24157 Zernike polynomials with numerically stable implementation

- Q-polynomials on unit disc

- in hardwar1.F: make setting USERHOME architecture independent


Done List
=========

- documentation in Open Document format
- removed functions for financial, stock market analysis
- sort out MY_GETCL*, JYSTEM* and MY_SYSTEM* subroutine messes
- random number generators are also from Numerical Recipes;
  subroutines 'ranran' and 'gasdev' --> replace
- replacement needed for sys_keyin.c (has not copyright)
- variable KODS_EDITOR, or some other way to configure editor
- remove common block SVD2 (optim10.f and optim3.f)
- replace all subroutines from "Numerical Recipes"
- build and installation instructions
- Installation process and installation options
- not all input can be made upper case. Prevent directory argument
  of LENSLOC to be changed to upper case.
- change lens directory from within Koko
- TAB completion at command input
- fix utility/utility7.f:lwrite: endless if ... then ..
